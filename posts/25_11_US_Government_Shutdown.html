            The US government lock-up prevented liquidity from flowing into markets through the Treasury
            General Account (TGA) and the reverse repo facility (RRP), amplifying Bitcoin’s decline.
          </p>

          <div class="section-label">TL;DR</div>
          <p class="tldr">
            At the same moment Japan was sucking liquidity out of global markets, the US was unable to
            pump liquidity back in. The TGA and RRP—two major liquidity release valves—were effectively
            frozen. This removed the usual stabilising flows and let the carry-trade shock turn into a
            sharper, faster sell-off.
          </p>

          <div class="section-label">Chain of events</div>
          <div class="body-text">
            <p>
              The US government lock-up meant Treasury operations were restricted. Normally, when
              funding markets wobble, the Treasury General Account can shift cash into the financial
              system, acting as a countercyclical liquidity buffer. At the same time, the reverse repo
              facility serves as a reservoir of cash that can flow back into markets when demand for
              liquidity spikes.
            </p>

            <p>
              During the lock-up, both mechanisms were essentially stuck. The Treasury could not
              meaningfully move funds from the TGA into the system, and the RRP could not unwind at the
              pace needed to stabilise markets. The usual safety valves were closed.
            </p>

            <p>
              Meanwhile, Japan was draining liquidity by forcing the yen carry trade to unwind — a major
              funding channel for global risk assets. Normally the US would offset at least part of this
              shock through TGA movements or RRP drawdowns. But this time, nothing happened. Liquidity
              tightened globally, with no relief from the world's largest financial system.
            </p>

            <p>
              With Japan pulling liquidity out and the US unable to push liquidity in, risk assets faced
              a simultaneous squeeze. Bitcoin, sitting at the crossroads of global 24/7 liquidity,
              reacted immediately and violently.
            </p>

          <div class="section-label">Summary &amp; conclusion</div>
          <div class="body-text">
            <p>
              The crash wasn’t about crypto fundamentals. It was about liquidity mechanics misfiring in
              two major economies at the same time. Japan tightened liquidity. The US failed to loosen
              it because of a procedural freeze. Bitcoin simply transmitted the signal.
            </p>
            <p>
              As liquidity normalises, risk appetite will return — and crypto will remain the most
              sensitive indicator of global liquidity conditions.
