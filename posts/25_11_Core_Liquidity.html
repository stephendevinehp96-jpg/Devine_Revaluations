            In the short to medium term, the main driver of asset prices is not “fundamentals” in the
            textbook sense, but the amount, price and direction of liquidity in the system.
          </p>

          <div class="section-label">TL;DR</div>
          <p class="tldr">
            Since 2000 – and decisively since the 2008 crisis – markets have become tightly linked to
            global liquidity. Central bank balance sheets, credit cycles and carry trades explain more
            of the big swings in equities, bonds and crypto than traditional valuation models.
          </p>

            <p>
              In the dot-com era, cheap credit and loose conditions fuelled a classic equity bubble.
              When liquidity was withdrawn and rates rose, the air came out. The pattern repeated into
              2008, but with leverage concentrated in housing and shadow banking rather than tech stocks.
            </p>
            <p>
              Post-2008, central banks crossed a line: QE, near-zero rates and explicit backstopping of
              markets. The result was a regime where risk assets became a derivative of central bank
              balance sheets and dollar funding conditions. Whenever liquidity surged, valuations did
              too. Whenever liquidity tightened, everything sold off together.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crypto simply joined this ecosystem with higher beta. Bitcoin and other major tokens now
              trade less like “uncorrelated alternatives” and more like leveraged plays on global
              dollar, euro and yen liquidity.
            </p>

          <div class="section-label">Summary &amp; conclusion</div>
          <div class="body-text">
            <p>
              Demographics set the slow backdrop; liquidity decides how violently markets oscillate
              around it. Watching global liquidity – central bank balance sheets, credit growth, carry
              trades and fiscal flows – is, in my view, the most useful single lens for understanding
              where asset prices are heading over the next 6–24 months.

              Devine Revaluations exists to track that interaction: long-run demographic pressure and
              short-run liquidity waves, and what they imply for portfolios and policy.
