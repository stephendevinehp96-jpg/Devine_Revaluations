          <p class="focal-point">
            Bitcoin’s sudden drop toward $80k wasn’t a “crypto crash.” It was a global liquidity shock
            triggered by a spike in Japanese Government Bond yields after Japan announced a $135bn
            stimulus package.
          </p>

          <div class="section-label">TL;DR</div>
          <p class="tldr">
            Japan’s new stimulus pushed JGB yields sharply higher. Higher yields destabilised the yen
            carry trade—a core source of global leveraged liquidity. As the carry trade unwound, risk
            assets were dumped mechanically, and Bitcoin—being the most liquidity-sensitive asset on the
            planet—reacted first and fastest.
          </p>

          <div class="section-label">Chain of events</div>
          <div class="body-text">
            <p>
              Japan fires a $135bn fiscal package into the system. Markets instantly price in more JGB
              issuance and a steeper yield curve. JGB yields spike. That sounds like an obscure footnote,
              but it’s a brick through the window of global funding markets.
            </p>
            <p>
              The yen carry trade depends on low Japanese yields. Investors borrow in yen at ultra-cheap
              rates and buy higher-yielding assets elsewhere. It’s one of the quiet pillars of global
              liquidity. When JGB yields jump, this trade stops being “free money” and starts being
              dangerous. Funding costs rise. FX hedging costs rise. Risk models panic.
            </p>
            <p>
              When funding trades break, investors don’t debate fundamentals—they dump risk to unwind
              leverage. That selling cascades across equities, emerging markets, and crypto. Bitcoin,
              which trades like a pure bet on global liquidity, absorbs the shock immediately. It falls
              towards the high $70ks not because anything in crypto changed, but because one of the
              world’s major liquidity pipes suddenly slammed shut.
            </p>

          <div class="section-label">Summary &amp; conclusion</div>
          <div class="body-text">
            <p>
              This wasn’t a crypto-specific event. It was a liquidity event. Global markets run on cheap
              funding, and when Japan disrupts the cost of money, everything priced on liquidity
              reprices. Bitcoin is simply the most honest barometer. When liquidity breaks, it falls
              first. When liquidity returns, it recovers first.
