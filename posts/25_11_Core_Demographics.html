            Demographics are the slow, predictable force that shapes long-run productivity, debt
            dynamics and growth, and therefore the background regime for markets, politics and society.
          </p>

          <div class="section-label">TL;DR</div>
          <p class="tldr">
            Age structures don’t grab headlines, but they decide most of the game. Economies with
            growing working-age populations can sustain higher growth and more debt. Ageing, shrinking
            societies face weaker productivity, heavier welfare burdens and a growing reliance on cheap
            money and financial engineering to keep the system moving.
          </p>

            <p>
              Start with something simple: people drive demand and supply. The 25–50 cohort tends to be
              the most productive and the biggest consumer. When this group is expanding, you get strong
              labour supply, investment, household formation and risk-taking. When it plateaus or
              shrinks, you get the opposite.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the share of retirees rises, more of national income is pulled toward pensions,
              healthcare and transfers. Governments either raise taxes, cut services, or lean on debt.
              Since 2000, most rich countries quietly chose option three: push up public debt, suppress
              interest rates and hope productivity or inflation will fix the real burden later.
            </p>
            <p>
              Markets then “solve” the gap with asset inflation. With too much savings chasing too few
              real growth opportunities, capital piles into financial assets. Equities, property and
              bonds are bid up, not because future growth is amazing, but because the demographic tide
              forces capital to seek yield anywhere it can.
            </p>

          <div class="section-label">Summary &amp; conclusion</div>
          <div class="body-text">
            <p>
              Demographics don’t tell you what the S&amp;P will do next quarter. They tell you what kind
              of world policymakers are trapped in over the next 10–30 years. Ageing societies with high
              debt and low productivity will lean on financial repression, negative real rates and
              repeated interventions.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s the iceberg beneath everything else on Devine Revalutions: liquidity, policy and
              politics are often just surface reactions to demographic realities that barely move, but
              never stop.
